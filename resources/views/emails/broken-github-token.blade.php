<p>Hello {{$user->name}},</p>

<p>it seems Giscus is not able to connect to your GitHub account anymore. Probably the authorization was revoked on the GitHub settings page. If this happened due to a mistake, you can simply reconnect your account by visiting the following link: <a href="https://giscus.co/auth/github">https://giscus.co/auth/github</a>. If in the other hand this was correct, no trouble, we're glad to have had you with us.</p>

<p>We hope to see you back soon!</p>
<p>The Giscus team.</p>
